These were developed by an AI based on its review of course content, syllabi, etc. I haven't reviewed these observations for truth-value.

I've just introduced a small change.

Here is a list of 15 fundamental principles of my "Intro to Game Design" course, IMS212. In this course, we build analog-prototypes of table-top games in order to train students for work as game designers and game developers.

1. The course teaches game design as systems design.
Students learn that games are composed of interacting variables, feedback loops, incentives, and state changes—not merely stories, aesthetics, or themes.

2. Analog prototyping is a foundation, not a detour.
Paper components let students revise rapidly, model systems cheaply, and focus attention on rules, choices, and structure before touching digital tools.

3. Iterative design is the course's spine.
Each prototype passes through multiple cycles of pitch → build → test → revise → present, emphasizing the designer's responsibility to respond to real playtest data.

4. "Meaningful choices" are a required literacy.
Every assignment stresses that players' decisions must genuinely alter state, outcomes, or strategy; randomness alone cannot carry the weight of interest.

5. Students must think concretely in terms of core loops.
Each project requires an articulated, repeatable turn structure that organizes player action, pacing, and escalation.

6. Systems must be quantified, not hand-waved.
Students justify numbers (movement points, resource rates, thresholds, etc.) and understand how tuning affects balance, difficulty, and player experience.

7. Simulation thinking is introduced early.
Prototype 3 (the race-simulation) introduces causal chains, environmental and agent systems, balancing vs. reinforcing loops, and the idea that randomness is optional.

8. Playtesting with non-specialists is essential.
The class culture treats testing as a research practice—students gather real feedback, identify consistent failures, and revise accordingly.

9. Students must explain their designs as intentional arguments.
Design is never "because it seemed fun." They articulate:
	•	what experience they aimed for,
	•	which mechanics produce it, and
	•	why alternatives didn't fit.

10. The course rewards clarity of rules and onboarding.
Students learn that a good game must be teachable, internally consistent, and understandable by players with no prior tutorial.

11. Games are treated as rhetorical and expressive systems.
Even in design 101, students are exposed to the idea that mechanics communicate values, assumptions, and models of the world (a soft runway toward your Rhetoric of Games class).

12. Collaboration is a pedagogical goal, not a side effect.
Group prototypes help students learn division of labor, documentation, design communication, and how to negotiate creative differences.

13. Constraints are generative.
Your assignments deliberately limit components, time, or mechanics, teaching students that creativity benefits from focused boundaries.

14. The course builds a gradually expanding conceptual toolkit.
Students accumulate:
	•	Juul's ideas about rules and fiction,
	•	system loops,
	•	state machines,
	•	core loops,
	•	emergent behavior,
	•	player agency,
and then apply them cumulatively in later prototypes.

15. The tone of the course is constructive, exploratory, and intellectually ambitious.
Although introductory, the course expects real thinking: modeling, analysis, structural criticism, and reflective practice—not just "make something cool."
